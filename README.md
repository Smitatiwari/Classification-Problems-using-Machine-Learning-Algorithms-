# Classification-Problems-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms-
Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are used to classify various classification problems like cancer cell classification into two classes- malignant and benign using Support Vector Machines (SVM), customer churn prediction using Logistic Regression (LR), customer categeory classification using K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and drugs classification using Decision Tree (DT). The dataset is divided into training and testing set. The ML models are trained on the training set. The performance of the model is tested on unseen test dataset using various performance metrices such as accuracy, F1-score, and Jaccard coefficients.
